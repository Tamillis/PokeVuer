<h1>PokeVuer</h1>
<h2> A PokemonAPI viewer using Vue JS </h2>

To run ensure PHP, Laravel and NPM are installed.

Clone this repository and open it in your editor of choice.

I used MySQL in XAMPP for local developement, but please configure .env to use your database of choice.

Run the following commands;
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed (note this will take a short while as pokemonapi.co must respond to requests)
php artisan serve

Click on the link provided and view the local server to see the project.
